  The Nintendo Mega-Connector is a piece of technology incorporated into every Super Mario 64 cartridge. It is a chip that connects wirelessly to a large server in the Nintendo HQ that gives all the space any cartridge would need for any level of personalization. The server itself is rumored to be the size of a regular house, though this is unconfirmed. It is currently unknown how it uses the space from the servers.
